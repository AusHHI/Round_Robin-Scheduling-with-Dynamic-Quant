# Round_Robin-Scheduling-with-Dynamic-Quant
Round Robin algorithm with dynamic quant implemented in java(using Array) and same implemented in C (using linked list)
This CPU Scheduling Algorithm calculates Throuhput, Utilization, Turn Around time, Waiting Time. Gantt chart displayed for all n processes.N process are executed in time frame of variable quants.Data Structure used in C is Linked List for Dynamic Allocation.
